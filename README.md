# XML-Project
This is Project is the Semester Project for (Data Structures and Algorithms | CSE331s)
## Background
In the first phase in this project, we are going to develop a tool that allows the user to check if the XML file is valid, and if it is. He will be able to format it to increase the readability and to be more informative. Furthermore, many languages do not have XML parsers as perfect as JSON parsers, so the user is able to convert the XML file to a JSON file.

For more complex and bigger relationships. Many XML files may be used, and the files size may increase too, which consumes data and time. So, we have provided the user with the ability to compress the file and reduce its size.

## Implementation Details
